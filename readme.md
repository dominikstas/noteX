## Description

NoteX is a lightweight note-taking application designed for easy use. It provides basic functionality for creating, editing, and saving notes. The application features a simple user interface with a toolbar for quick access to common actions. The motivation behind its creation is quite simple; I needed an application to take notes for my studies that works on Ubuntu, doesn't require any subscriptions, or involve payments. So, I thought, "Why not create it myself?"

## Features

- Create, edit, and save notes
- Dark mode for comfortable use in low-light environments
- Customizable font size
- Quick access to common actions through the toolbar
- Automatic mode to switch between light and dark modes based on user preferences
