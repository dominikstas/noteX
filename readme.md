##NoteX v1.0

A Simple Note App
##What and Why

NoteX is currently a straightforward text editor with aspirations to evolve into a more modern and advanced writing application. The motivation behind its creation is quite simple; I needed an application to take notes for my studies that works on Ubuntu, doesn't require any subscriptions, or involve payments. So, I thought, "Why not create it myself?"

##v1.0

At its current version (v1.0), NoteX is essentially a simple notepad with the following features:

    Write notes
    Open and edit .txt files
    Save files

That's it for now. However, future updates will introduce more features, and the design will undoubtedly become more aesthetically pleasing.


##Tech

NoteX is written in Python, utilizing PyQt5 for the user interface.
