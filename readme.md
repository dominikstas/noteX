# NoteX v1.1

A Simple Note App

## What and Why

NoteX is currently a straightforward text editor with aspirations to evolve into a more modern and advanced writing application. The motivation behind its creation is quite simple; I needed an application to take notes for my studies that works on Ubuntu, doesn't require any subscriptions, or involve payments. So, I thought, "Why not create it myself?"

## v1.1
At its current version (v1.1), NoteX is essentially a simple notepad with the following features:

- Write notes
- Open and edit .txt files
- Save files
- Light/Dark mode
- Popping alert when you forget to save your note
- It shows name of the open file
- Better design (a little)
- Navbar file menu ('note' button)

That's it for now. However, future updates will introduce more features, and the design will undoubtedly become more aesthetically pleasing.


## Tech

NoteX is written in Python, utilizing PyQt5 for the user interface and SQLite for the 
auto dark mode function.
